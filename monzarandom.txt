once on our new server

type in scp setup/something_else.sh root@<vip_address>:/tmp

root can mean 3 things:
root  -root user
/     -root directory
/root -a directory literally called root that isn't the root directory; it's the home directory of the root user: it's weirdly not in the /home directory




scp -r (folder)
then ssh in

update

test is to create a flask app and put it online

http: //$IP_ADDRESS: $PORT_NUMBER /$NAMESPACE

...this in browser should lead to
$NAMESPACE

a controller that spits out a website that has the text of whatever the namespace is


take everything from a file, write it to a database... IE equities today. bats_symbols_traded_bzx.csv

creating a bunch of tables with the names
can be hash

bunch of stuff in the controllers directory
bunch of stuff in templates
front page
Login page

creat a file that sanitizes the strings...   throw and underscore infront of all the names ...any symbol or combo of numbers
    certification, .bats_symbols_traded_bzx

    download copy of python3 reserved words
# hashing function
    create a lookup table

    create a dictionary

    CREATE a scheme to sanitize input

    cant go wrong with a single _ first or after _

    change host to '0.0.0.0', port = 5000 to deploy in flask

    make sure hash tag

read all the namespaces into the list
create a bunch of copies
for _ in list of namespaces

register blueprint in the __init__ file

setup directory
sanitize.py
templates for your output files
run directory
